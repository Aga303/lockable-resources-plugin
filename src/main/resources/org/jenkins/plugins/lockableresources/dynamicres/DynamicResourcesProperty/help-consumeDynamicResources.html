		If checked, each matrix configuration in this project will consume exactly <b>one</b>
		resource created by other jobs. The dynamic resource's configuration is based on the matrix
		configuration currently running (ignoring the axis marked as such), 
		the injected parameter, and the name of this project.
	<p>
		The number of resources consumed is always equal to one; the build waits for any dynamic
		resources that match its matrix configuration, have the same parameter name and value
		as expected, and are created for this job. When such resource is found, it will be consumed
		(destroyed) and the build will start.
	<p style="color:red"><b>
		The configuration for the dynamic resources created has to be identical to that of the
		dynamic resources consumed. If any parameter in the configuration does not match,
		the resources created will not be acknowledged as consumable by the other jobs.</b>
