	<p>
		By default builds a queued without any restriction on waiting to lock a common resource
		Setting this parameter a limit is forced in the number of waiting builds. Any build trying to lock after
		the limit is reached will trigger a cancel round trip which will abort the older waiting build.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, if builds #3 and #4 are waiting to lock the resource and build #5 reaches the lock step,
		then build #3 will be cancelled in favor of #5 which is newer.
